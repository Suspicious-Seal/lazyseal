## lazyseal

lazyseal is a system that installs all of my personal favourite packages, and sets up my development environment perfectly.
This might not match your preferences, and that's totally fine! This was meant for me to be able to set up my dev env
environment automatically, without the hassle of reconfiguring everything whenever i start something new.

# Enjoy!
